		<p>A common notion in ultimate is that the game is played differently across the three divisions - Men’s, Mixed, and Women’s - with people often citing differences in strategy, execution, and dynamism.
			<br><br>This analysis aims to address this notion, along with providing data on baseline metrics, by analyzing 30 elite games - ten within each division. These games include the final and semifinal games of the Triple Crown Tour tournaments (US Open, Pro Championships, and National Club Championships) from 2016-2018.<br><br>
			Overall, results are mixed. Some metrics reveal clear differences across the divisions, while others show shockingly similar results. Take a look!</p>
