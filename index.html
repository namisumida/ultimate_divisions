		<p>A common notion in ultimate is that the game is played differently between the three divisions - Men’s, Mixed, and Women’s - people often citing differences in strategy, execution, and dynamism.
			<br><br>This analysis aims to address this notion, along with providing data on baseline metrics, by analyzing 30 elite games - ten within each division. These games include games of the Triple Crown Tour - the US Open, Pro Championships, and National Club Championships - from 2016-2018. Data were recorded by watching games through USA Ultimate’s YouTube videos and Ultiworld’s video store. The offensive metrics that were compared include types of throws attempted, completion rates, types of throws that led to scores, offensive efficiency metrics, turnover rates, and field positioning after turnovers.<br><br>Overall, results are contradictory to the idea that the game is played differently by divisions as a surprisingly low number of differences emerge.</p>
