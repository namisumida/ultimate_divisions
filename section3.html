	  <h2>3. Defensive points</h2>
	  <p>As expected, the D-lines on winning teams are able to gain possession and convert. In the Men’s and Women’s divisions, winning teams were able to gain possession - either through defensive plays or the opposing team making mistakes - in more than three out of five of their defensive points (65% and 63%, respectively). This number is lower for winning teams in the Mixed division - 54%.<br><br>But while these teams gain possession in a majority of their defensive points, they were unable to convert on all of them. There is about a 10-20 percentage-point difference between the portion of D-line points in which they gained possession (also known as had-disc points) and the portion in which they scored. Yet they still achieve at least a 30% D-line conversion rate, which is what some consider to be a minimum threshold for club teams’ D-lines.<br><br></p>

	  <p>To understand the differences between a team’s O-line and D-line offensive efficiency, we can rebase the D-line scores to find the share of points that were converted when the D-line gained possession. In other words, we isolate the points in which the D-line gained possession, and find the portion of these points that resulted in their score. <br><br>With this, we find that winning teams’ D-lines were able to score about two-thirds of the time. This is, however, markedly lower than O-lines’ offensive efficiency for all three divisions.<br><br>This is not to say that the O-line is better at scoring than the D-line because their starting situations greatly differ; the D-line must work to gain possession, while the O-line does not. Therefore, an explanation for the gaps in conversion rates may be due to D-line exhaustion from playing defense, along with other possible reasons, such as line-specific playing styles and personnel.<br><br></p>
