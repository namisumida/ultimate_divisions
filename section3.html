	  <h2>3. Defensive points</h2>
	  <p>As expected, the D-lines on winning teams are able to gain possession and convert. In the Men’s and Mixed divisions, winning teams are able to gain possession - either by defensive plays or the opposing team making mistakes - in about six-in-ten defensive points (58%), while those in the Women's division are able to do so at higher rates (66%).<br><br>
			But while these teams gain possession in a majority of their defensive points, they are unable to convert on all of them. There is about a 15-25 percentage-point difference between the portion of D-line points in which they gain possession (also known as had-disc points) and the portion in which they score. Yet they still achieve at least a 30% D-line conversion rate, which is <a href="https://skydmagazine.com/2012/11/measuring-possession/">what some consider</a> to be a minimum threshold for club teams’ D-lines.<br><br>
			The higher rate of had-disc defensive points among the Women's division's winning teams is likely tied to their slightly higher turnover rate. Furthermore, while these Women's teams gain the disc more often on their defensive points, they are not any more likely than those in the other divisions to convert these points, further implying that more inefficiencies may occur in Women's games.

	  <p>To understand the differences between a team’s O-line and D-line offensive efficiency, we can rebase the D-line scores to find the share of points that were converted when the D-line gained possession. In other words, we isolate the points in which the D-line gained possession, and find the portion of these points that resulted in their score. With this, we find that winning teams’ D-lines are able to score a large majority of the time - though less often among Women's teams (as we saw in the previous graphic). <br><br>
			This offensive efficiency is, however, markedly lower than O-lines’ offensive efficiency for all three divisions. This is not to say that the O-line is better at scoring than the D-line because their starting situations greatly differ: the D-line must work to gain possession, while the O-line does not. Therefore, an explanation for the gaps in conversion rates may be due to D-line exhaustion from playing defense, along with other possible reasons, such as line-specific playing styles and personnel.</p>
