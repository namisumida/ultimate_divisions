    <h2>Appendix</h2>
    <h3>Sample</h3>
    <p>Data were collected for the final and semi-final games of 2017 Nationals, the final games of the 2017 Pro Championships, and the final games of the 2017 US Open. The teams that competed along with the ending score and links to the videos that were used in data collection are below.</p>
    <h4>Men's games</h4>
    <p>2018 games</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Nationals final</a>: PoNY (15) vs. Revolver (7)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2017 games</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Nationals final</a>: Revolver (15) vs. Doublewide (10)</li>
      <li><a>Nationals semifinal 1</a>: Revolver (15) vs. Ring of Fire (14)</li>
      <li><a>Nationals semifinal 2</a>: Doublewide (15) vs. Truck Stop (10)</li>
      <li><a>Pro Championships final</a>: Revolver (15) vs. Machine (10)</li>
      <li><a>US Open final</a>: Sockeye (15) vs. Revolver (10)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2016 games</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Nationals final</a>: Ironside (14) vs. Revolver (13)</li>
      <li><a>Nationals semifinal 1</a>: Revolver (13) vs. Ring of Fire (12)</li>

      <li><a>US Open final</a>: Machine (15) vs. Sockeye (12)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The final game of Nationals is missing the first two points because the video started midway through the second point. For the semi-final game of Nationals between Doublewide and Truck Stop, data is missing for the 11th point due to poor video quality.</p>

      <h3>Data collection</h3>
      <p>For each game, the following were collected: occurrence of every throw (categorized by throw type), every turnover, and every score; field position at the start of every possession; ending score of every point - all in the order in which it occurred.<br><br>Categorization of throw types occurred concurrently with data collection using the following definitions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Huck</strong>: A throw that, on average, covers longer distances than most downfield throws, typically has some float/air to it, and is thrown to someone who is running away from the disc/thrower. A huck may be determined differently per division and thrower.</li>
        <li><strong>Short/mid-range downfield throw</strong>: A short or mid-range throw that primarily moves the disc down the field - but does not cover as much distance as a huck.</li>
        <li><strong>Dump</strong>: A throw that primarily moves the disc backwards and is thrown to someone who is directly behind the person with the disc.</li>
        <li><strong>Swing</strong>: A throw that primarily moves the disc laterally as opposed to vertically, or is meant to “center” the disc rather than advance vertically towards the end zone. It is differentiated from a short/mid-range downfield throw based on whether it covers more lateral vs. vertical distance. And it is differentiated from a dump based on if the throw is meant as a centering pass and/or if the receiver does not come directly behind the thrower.</li>
        <li><strong>Upside-down</strong>: A hammer, scoober, or any other throw in which the disc is upside-down.</li>
        <li><strong>Dish</strong>: A throw that results in minimal positional (vertical or lateral) difference. These throws were only measured when playing against a zone/junk defense; when against a person defense, this throw would be categorized as a dump, swing, or short/mid-range downfield throw accordingly.</li>
      </ul>
