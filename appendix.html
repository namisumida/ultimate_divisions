    <h4>Men's games</h4>
    <p>2018 games</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Nationals final</a>: PoNY (15) vs. Revolver (7)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2017 games</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJm2Kj-Kapc">Nationals final</a>: Revolver (15) vs. Doublewide (10)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4YJdJ_-4UY">Nationals semifinal 1</a>: Revolver (15) vs. Ring of Fire (14)</li>

      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGnwDjZURzQ">Pro Championships final</a>: Revolver (15) vs. Machine (10)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dtUsvXk428">US Open final</a>: Sockeye (15) vs. Revolver (10)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2016 games</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aKWCXCf5Fs">Nationals final</a>: Ironside (14) vs. Revolver (13)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqIkvKHssmY">Nationals semifinal 1</a>: Revolver (13) vs. Ring of Fire (12)</li>

      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBXuBYusG0o">US Open final</a>: Machine (15) vs. Sockeye (12)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The final game of Nationals is missing the first two points because the video started midway through the second point. For the semi-final game of Nationals between Doublewide and Truck Stop, data is missing for the 11th point due to poor video quality.</p>

      <h3>Data collection</h3>
      <p>For each game, the following were collected: occurrence of every throw (categorized by throw type), every turnover, and every score; field position at the start of every possession; ending score of every point - all in the order in which it occurred.<br><br>Categorization of throw types occurred concurrently with data collection using the following definitions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Huck</strong>: A throw that, on average, covers longer distances than most downfield throws, typically has some float/air to it, and is thrown to someone who is running away from the disc/thrower. A huck may be determined differently per division and thrower.</li>
        <li><strong>Short/mid-range downfield throw</strong>: A short or mid-range throw that primarily moves the disc down the field, but does not cover as much distance as a huck.</li>
        <li><strong>Dump</strong>: A throw that primarily moves the disc backwards and is thrown to someone who is directly behind the person with the disc.</li>
        <li><strong>Swing</strong>: A throw that primarily moves the disc laterally as opposed to vertically, or is meant to “center” the disc rather than advance vertically towards the end zone. It is differentiated from a short/mid-range downfield throw based on whether it covers more lateral vs. vertical space. It is differentiated from a dump based on if the throw is meant as a centering pass and/or if the receiver does not come directly behind the thrower.</li>
        <li><strong>Upside-down</strong>: A hammer, scoober, or any other throw in which the disc is upside-down.</li>
        <li><strong>Dish</strong>: A throw that results in minimal positional (vertical or lateral) difference. These throws were only measured when playing against a zone/junk defense; when against a person defense, this throw would be categorized as a dump, swing, or short/mid-range downfield throw accordingly.</li>
      </ul>
