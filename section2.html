		<h2>2. Offensive points</h2>
		<p>In all three divisions, the winning teams convert about eight-in-ten of all of their offensive points: 81% for Men's, 78% for Mixed, and 78% for Women's (in-line with <a href="https://skydmagazine.com/2012/11/measuring-possession/">expectations</a> for most elite club teams).<br><br>However, many of these are not without turnovers. For the winning teams in the Women’s and Mixed divisions, about half of all offensive points are single-possession scores (i.e. without turnovers). In contrast, the winning teams in the Men’s division stand out, scoring 61% of their offensive points in one possession.</p>

		<p>It is important to note that the chart above only shows metrics for the <em>winning</em> teams. The winning teams in the Women's division only include four teams: Boston Brute Squad (4), San Francisco Fury (3), Seattle Riot (2), and Columbia Revolution. Similarly, only four teams are represented in the Mixed division: Seattle Mixtape (4), Boston Slow White (3), Philadelphia AMP (2), and Metro North. In the Men's division, however, there is a somewhat wider spread of teams: San Francisco Revolver (4), Boston Ironside (2), Chicago Machine, New York PoNY, Austin Doublewide, and Seattle Sockeye.<br><br>While winning teams clearly have more offensive holds than losing teams, it may not necessarily be the case that their offensive holds are more likely to be single-possession scores. But since losing teams are already less likely than winning teams to score at all, if we compare the share of offensive points that are single-possession scores, losing teams are automatically at a disadvantage. So instead, we must change the base from “all offensive points” to “all offensive holds”. Whereas previously we asked, “How often do teams score in a single possession?” we now ask: “When teams do score, how often do they score in one possession?”
			<br><br>Winning teams in the Men's and Women's divisions are somewhat more likely than losing teams to score offensive points in a single possession (by 5 and 8 percentage-points, respectively). Interestingly, in the Mixed division, winning teams are <em>less</em> likely to offensively hold with single-possession scores - by 7 percentage-points.</p>
