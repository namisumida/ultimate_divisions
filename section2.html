		<h2>2. Offensive points</h2>
		<p>In all three divisions, the winning teams converted about eight-in-ten of all of their offensive points: 80% for Mixed, 78% for Men's, and 78% for Women's - in-line with <a href="">expectations</a> for most elite club teams.<br><br>While a large majority of these points were holds, a sizable portion of them were not without turnovers. For the winning teams in the Women’s and Mixed divisions, about four-in-ten of all offensive points were single-possession scores (i.e. without turnovers). In contrast, the winning teams in the Men’s division stand out, having scored 56% of their offensive points in one possession.<br><br></p>

		<p>It is important to note that the chart above only shows metrics for the winning teams. The winning teams in the Women's division only include the top four teams: Boston Brute Squad (4), San Francisco Fury (3), Seattle Riot (2), and Columbia Revolution. Similarly, only four teams are represented in the Mixed division: Seattle Mixtape (4), Boston Slow White (3), Philadelphia AMP (2), and Metro North. In the Men's division, however, there is a somewhat wider spread of teams: San Francisco Revolver (4), Boston Ironside (2), Chicago Machine, New York PoNY, Austin Doublewide, and Seattle Sockeye.<br><br></p>
		<p>While winning teams clearly have more offensive holds than losing teams, it is not necessarily the case that their offensive holds are more likely to be single-possession scores. In fact, a range of differences emerges between the two types of teams in how often they score in a single possession. However, losing teams are already less likely than winning teams to score at all. Therefore, if we compare the share of offensive points that had single-possession scores, losing teams are automatically at a disadvantage. So instead, we must change the base from “all offensive points” to “all offensive holds”. Whereas previously we asked, “How often do teams score in a single possession?” we now ask: “When teams do score, how often are they in one possession?”<br><br>In the Women’s division, the winning and losing teams had the same share of offensive holds that were scored without turnovers, at around 60%. In the Men’s division, the winning teams - mainly Revolver - were not only more likely to score, but to do so with single-possession scores - by 17 percentage-points. The Mixed division, on the other hand, had losing teams holding with single-possession scores more often than winning teams by 12 points. Therefore, the winning teams - mainly Mixtape - were more likely than losing teams to score their offensive points, but not without error.<br><br>It’s impossible to tell whether these differences in the Men’s and Mixed divisions are real differences between teams that win and teams that lose, or instead are characteristic differences between Revolver/Mixtape and other teams. However, the similarity found in the Women’s division - in which no single team dominates wins/losses - may imply the latter.<br><br></p>
