		<h2>1. Throws and turnovers</h2>
		<p>In general, how often certain types of throws occur are similar across the three divisions. Of five types of throws that were measured - hucks, swings, dumps, upside-down throws (e.g., hammers, scoobers), short/mid-range downfield throws - at least 50% are short/mid-range downfield throws. The next most common throw is a swing, thrown about 30% of the time. Dumps and hucks each occur about 10% of the time. And lastly, upside-down throws are used 1% of the time of less.</p>

		</section>
		<p>Similar to attempt rates, completion rates do not vary much by division. The throws that are most often completed are dumps and swings, followed by short/mid-range downfield throws - each type completed about 90% of the time or more often. Hucks come in last with about a 50% chance of success - far less successful than any other throw. (Upside-down throws did not occur often enough to be included in this analysis.)</p>

		</section>
		<p>Despite similar attempt and completion rates, when it comes to throws that lead to scores (i.e. the scoring throw), differences appear. Women’s teams overwhelmingly score with short/mid-range downfield throws, with about three-quarters of scores (72%) resulting from these throws. Meanwhile, a quarter come from hucks.
			<br><br>In the Men’s and Mixed divisions, the breakdown is more spread out. Roughly six-in-ten of all scores come from short/mid-range downfield throws (58% and 57%, respectively), while about a third are from hucks (34% and 36%, respectively).<br><br></p>
		<p>Looking at the number of throws can provide insight into the pace of the game; the more throws that occur in a given timeframe, the faster the play may progress. Games in the Men’s division had, on average, the fewest number of throws (319), while games in the Women's division had the most (379). Mixed games lie in between, with an average of 331 throws.<br><br>There is the most variation in Women's games, with one game under 250 throws (which had an ending score of 15-5) and one game over 500 (ending score of 15-14) - both of which were semifinal games at Club Nationals. Interestingly, the 2017 Women's games are all at the lower end - all under 380 throws and averaging 331 throws. Games in the Men's and Mixed divisions are relatively consistent, with a range of 100.</p>

		</section>
		<p>On average, about half of all points in a Men's and Mixed division game have at least one turnover. Moreover, in points with turnovers, on average, about 2 of them occur. Turnovers occur somewhat more often in Women's games: 59% of points experience a turnover, and about 3 of them occur in these points.<br><br>These rates, however, are fairly similar across the divisions - so similar that it's unclear whether a spectator watching an average game from each division would notice any significant differences in turnovers - in absolute number or in rate of occurrence.</p>
		<p>Off of an opposing team’s turnover, Men’s and Mixed teams find themselves starting in their defending end zone and having to traverse the full field about 60% of the time. However, this happens 45% of the time for Women’s teams, and instead, much of their pickups off of a turnover (51%) are somewhere in between the two end zones. In other words, after generating a turnover, Women’s teams are more likely than Mixed or Men's teams to pick up the disc farther down the field and not need to traverse as many yards to score.</p>
